### Branching Strategy

**Goal: NEVER Break Master**

1. Pull from Master to get the most recent updates ```git pull```.
2. Branch off of Master ```git checkout -b BranchName```.
3. *Change the code at this stage.*
4. Add and commit the changes ```git add *``` ```git commit -m "Commit Message"```
5. Push the changes to GitHub ```git push -u origin BranchName```.
6. Go to GitHub.
    1. Navigate to your Branch.
    2. Click Create New Pull Request.
    3. Submit the Pull Request.
    4. Merge the Pull Request into Master.
    5. Delete your Branch on GitHub.
7. Checkout to Master ```git checkout master```.
8. Delete your Branch locally ```git branch -d BranchName```.
9. Pull the latest changes to your machine ```git pull```.
